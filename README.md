# Spaceman

The spaceman game is essentially a spin off of hangman. Normally, in order to play hangman in reality there will be at least two people playing. One person on picks a word and the other person has a certain number of guesses to pick that word. The certain number of guesses is determined by the person thought of the word and normally in the game they would draw different components of a man until the man is fully clothed, in which the guesser would be out of turns and loses the game. In this version of "Hangman" called Spaceman the user is automatically the guesser and the computer is the play that picks a random word.
